## Abstract

###### By nature, every living organism holds various sensory properties for perception. Among organisms, different types of core perception mechanisms can be found. Neuron cells in animals, action potentials (APs) (one of the other mechanisms) in plats, receptor proteins in bacteria for example- work as core sensory receptor units to respond to stimuli (environment/external change). Whatever mechanisms certain organisms hold for perception, the common thing is the sensory units act as black boxes to receive and generate sensory data. On top of that, it is discovered in a limited manner that those sensory units do not care about the external data structure if exposed to new data with artificial sensory data interface. Performing as a general-purpose data processing unit, they can adapt over time and interpret the new data accordingly; offering new sensory abilities. *DeepBios* is such a master project that considers this finding and investigates how far we can reach while leveraging the power of Deep Learning. Under the hood of *DeepBios*, the investigations involve- 1) design and development of low-cost small to large-scale sensory interface design, 2) creation of sensory dataset from various organisms; analysis and interpretation of sensory data, 3) high-level sensory modelling of organisms, 4) design and development of *Biological Processing Unit* (*BPU*) for general-purpose computing, 5) discovering fundamental biological operations beyond Boolean logic- *Live Logic*, 6) sensory modification and induction, 7) biological hardware and software design and development, 8) biological programming language (*LiveLang*); *Biological Language Processing* (*BLP*), 9) biological network (*LiveNet*) and data transfer through it and 10) sensory data security, vulnerabilities. This white paper outlines all such research topics with their internal relations and dependencies, describes their details with target findings, provides supporting backgrounds and references, breaks down their methodologies and presents basic intuitions with hypotheses in a step by step manner. In conclusion, this paper is the very first master plan of *DeepBios*.
